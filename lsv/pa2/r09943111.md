## LSV PA2 Report

### Used APIs
`Abc_NtkFindNode` Find the node corresponds to the output  

`Abc_NtkCreateCone` Create a cone with one output  

`Abc_NtkToDar` Obtain AIG circuit from a network  

`Cnf_Derive` Derife a cnf formula corresponds to AIG circuit  

`Cnf_DataDup` Duplicate a cnf formula in order to do unate checking  

`Cnf_DataLift` Lift the variable so that we can assign different value to the input  

`Cnf_DataWriteIntoSolver` Obtain a sat solver with the Cnf   

`sat_solver_setnvars` Set the variable of sat solver  

`sat_solver_addclause` Add another Cnf to sat solver clause by clause  

`sat_solver_add_buffer_enable` For each input pair add a enable varible to control the equality  

`sat_solver_solve` Incremental solve the sat with some assumption  


### Data structures

`map` store the mapping from **Aig input order** to **Network id** and from **Network id** to **input name**  

`vector` store the mapping of **CNF variable** to **AIG id** and each input is positive unate or not, negative unate or not  

### Observation  
Without pickup a output, selecting the hold circuit to do sat solving takes effort and is time consuming.
